# Wes Roach - Summary

I build and maintain software creating a more open and efficient health system. The health analytics space is a relatively niche and unconnected space for developers. Our team is creating opportunities for transparency and discussion within our professional community.

## Work

I lead a team of developers [@GDIT](https://www.gdit.com/) providing [insight and IT services](https://www.gdit.com/perspectives/our-stories/arkansas-a-first-in-rewards-based-payment-reform/) to the Arkansas Department of Human Services' Medicaid system.

I've worked on the [Arkansas Payment Improvement Initiative](https://achi.net/newsroom/report-ahcpii-improving-quality-efficiency/) since its inception in 2013 and serve as one of the lead analysts for the program.
